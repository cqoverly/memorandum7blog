What if we look at curriculum from the Mission out, looking at how upper courses apply to completing the mission, then at how the various courses leading to them feed them? Visually, the mission sits at the center, like a nucleus. As one moves outward the courses would generally rate from higher level, out to the foundational, lower level courses, namely.

We should also see connections where knowledge from the outer rings is transferred to the inner right, with skills from the outer rings being strengthened and being applied at deeper levels as they move inward toward the mission. Ideally, skills would not be taught at the outer rings if they are not applied and strengthened in the inner rings.

Courses in the outer rings would introduce knowledge and skills at a very low level and be applied in their most basic forms. Skills should be apparent in a course, and be essential to further progress in the curriculum. Skills introduced on the outer layer that do not make their way inward are likely to be lost quickly, and deemed useless, thus wasting time that could have been used for deeper instructional reinforcement of skills that do move inward, or provide time for skills left out that could have been learned and moved inward.

This idea of "moving skills into the center" is essential for growth and retention. Faculty often complain students have forgotten necessary knowledge and skills by the time they arrive at the higher level courses, thus requiring one or two days of review prior to starting on the new, deeper material that is the main focus of the course. This that a skill was either not reinforced somewhere in the middle ring of courses through which the student travelled, or that the material was introduced too early for the course that needed them.

The timing of the introduction of skills is made more complicated under curricula where students have more options in how they travel through the needed courses. More "linear" style curricula, where students have very limited control over what they take and when they take it, have the advantage of making sure students use skills in a step-by-step manner, where the timing of introduction and reinforcement is controlled, and necessary skills are entrenched when they are needed in the higher level courses.
